# 🌐 VELORA – Explore & List Hotels and Rest Areas

**Velora** is a simple full-stack website I built while learning web development.  
It's designed for people who love to travel — allowing users to explore hotels, rest areas, and even list their own places.  
Currently, the site focuses on browsing and listing locations. A booking system will be added soon.
